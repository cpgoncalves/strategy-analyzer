The Python module Strategy Analyzer is a decision support tool for analyzing complex dynamical webs of events 
and actions in strategic planning, intelligence and risk analysis.

The module has a built-in percolation-based artificial intelligence (A.I.) system that learns the paths in such webs and 
ranks the actions and events in terms of order of importance with re-gards to the strategic objectives, 
tactical openings and events openings.

In the following reference, the module's implementation is exemplified, the main connections to Strategic Studies are addressed 
and the A.I. system is reviewed:
